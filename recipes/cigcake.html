    <h1>Ciggy Butt Cake</h1>
    <img src="../images/cigcake.jpeg" width="600px" alt="Picture of finished cigarette cake taken from an above angle, presented in a beer carrying tray">
    <p>Tell me, when you go to a birthday party, you can probably count on one hand the type of cake that will be served. Sure, the odd vanilla, 
        chocolate, or even carrot cake is an enjoyable dessert, but how many parties have you attended where they really served something one of a kind?
        Something you've truly never seen before, something... carcinogenic even?
        Enter the Cigarette Cake. This subjectively delicious, fairly affordable ashtray of a dessert is bound to turn heads (and increase risk of all-cause mortality).
        This cake takes little to bake and can be fun getting all the ingredients! If you don't smoke yourself, ask a friend who does to bring over their discarded cigs. 
        Alternatively, just head to your local pub, grocery store parking lot, or city hall and dig away at some butts! 
        No one will care if you take their leftover cig ends. Bone-app-the-teeth!</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
